1. The project is implemented using JavaFX and JDK1.8.
2. The project uses Apache Commons Math Library for calculating the Monte Carlo Method. The jar file is in the "lib" folder of the project. 
3. The project dose not include Input validations and Exception Handling in this version.
4. I could not test the results with  Personal Capital, because I could not figure out how to use it. However, I believe my solution is correct.
